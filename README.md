# Kafka IRT voting App
Simple proof of concept for Kafka usages in a pub-sub architectural pattern. Note that kafka can be replaced for a Redis instance or a RabbitMQ but as a proof of concept, it does the job. Simply type docker-compose up and it will start all the dependancies needed for the project to run. Go to localhost:8080 to see the polls result and go to localhost:5000 to vote for your favorite pet.
Have Fun
